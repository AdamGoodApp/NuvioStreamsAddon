Rod Serling's narration from the second season was used, with the verse \"That's the signpost up ahead\" taken out:\n\n\"You're traveling through another dimension. A dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination. Your next stop—The Twilight Zone.\" Some subtle changes in the opening's acoustics were made beginning with Person or Persons Unknown.",

A very different and more complex set of graphics was used for the intro, and Rod Serling's narration changed from the earlier seasons as well:\n\n\"You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension. A dimension of sound. A dimension of sight. A dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into the Twilight Zone.\"",
