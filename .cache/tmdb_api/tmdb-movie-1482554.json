  "overview": "Jacob's got problems-deep, mental ones. Desperate for relief, he volunteers for a radical treatment to escape his tortured mind. But instead of peace, he finds himself trapped in a house with a tunnel to his subconscious. What begins as a path to healing becomes a harrowing descent where memory fractures, time distorts, and reality bends. A first-of-its-kind cinematic experience, Soul to Squeeze begins in a boxy 4:3 aspect ratio and ever so slowly widens to a full 2.35:1 by the final frame-mirroring Jacob's expanding perception as he risks everything for redemption. Visually daring and emotionally raw, Soul to Squeeze merges body with mind, taking audiences on a perilous journey through the psyche.",
