  "overview": "Nanami was just a normal high school girl down on her luck until a stranger’s lips marked her as the new Land God and turned her world upside down. Now, she’s figuring out the duties of a deity with the help of Tomoe, a reformed fox demon who reluctantly becomes her familiar in a contract sealed with a kiss. The new responsibilities—and boys—are a lot to handle, like the crow demon masquerading as a gorgeous pop idol and the adorable snake spirit who’s chosen the newly minted god to be his bride. As the headstrong Tomoe tries to whip her into shape, Nanami finds that love just might have cute, pointed fox ears. With romance in the air, will the human deity be able to prove herself worthy of her new title?",

One day, the wind god Otohiko comes to invite Nanami to the Divine Assembly in Izumo, the home of the gods, and Nanami decides to take Mizuki with her, leaving Tomoe to impersonate her at school. However, she has an ulterior motive for attending the Divine Assembly: to discover the whereabouts of the missing Lord Mikage, the former god of the shrine.\n\nAfter her adventures in Izumo, Nanami meets Botanmaru, a Tengu child who is looking for someone she knows very well: Shinjirou. Botanmaru needs Shinjirou, their prince, to return home to Mount Kurama and stop the tyranny of Jirou, who has taken over her hometown.\n\nAs a young goddess getting used to divinity, Nanami has to deal with a tengu rebellion, her blossoming feelings for Tomoe and a strange man with links to Tomoe's past and Nanami's future.",
