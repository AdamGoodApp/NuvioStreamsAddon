# Hey r/StremioAddons!

First of all, **I owe you all an apology.** If you installed my DC Universe or Star Wars Universe catalog addons using the links I previously shared, those links have stopped working. I didn't update everyone when the deployment broke, and I know many of you have been experiencing broken catalogs as a result. I'll provide the new links at the end of this post.

After creating the DC Universe and Star Wars Universe catalog addons, I've been working on a different type of project: the **Nuvio Streaming Addon** for Stremio.

Unlike my previous catalog-focused addons, this one is a scraper that attempts to find and deliver streams from various online sources. As with any scraper addon, please understand that reliability depends on external providers that may change or become unavailable over time.

# About this addon:

* **Limited Providers** - Currently includes only two providers which may break at any time
* **Content Availability** - Attempts to find streams for movies and TV shows when available
* **High Quality Support** - One provider supports 4K, HDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision content when available
* **Experimental Nature** - This is a work in progress with no guarantee on how long it will last
* **Indie Development** - As a solo developer, I'll try to fix or replace broken providers, but it may take time
* **No Guarantees** - Use with the understanding that functionality can change or disappear without warning
* **No P2P Technology** - This addon does not use torrents or P2P connections of any kind

>**Important Note:** This addon is highly experimental and currently relies on just two providers that could stop working at any moment. As an indie developer, I'll do my best to maintain it, but please have realistic expectations about its reliability and longevity.

**Disclaimer:** This is a personal project intended for educational purposes. Use at your own discretion.

# Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: Does this addon use torrents or P2P technology?**  
A: No. This addon only scrapes direct HTTP streams from websites. It does not use P2P, torrents, or any technology that would expose your IP address to other users.

**Q: Is this addon safe to use?**  
A: The addon itself is just a scraper that finds links. It doesn't host any content.

**Q: Why do some streams not work?**  
A: The providers this addon scrapes from can change their websites or go offline at any time. When this happens, streams will stop working until I can update the addon.

**Q: How often is the addon updated?**  
A: As an indie developer with limited time, I update when I can. If a provider breaks, I'll try to fix it or find a replacement, but this may take time.

**Q: Will more providers be added?**  
A: I hope to add more providers over time to improve reliability, but this depends on finding stable sources that can be integrated.

**Q: Can I self-host this addon or contribute to development?**  
A: The repository is private for various reasons. If you're interested in self-hosting or development, please send me a DM and we can discuss access.

**Q: Are there any bandwidth limitations?**  
A: Some providers have monthly bandwidth limitations. The addon implements certain optimizations to help with this. In the future, I may add more customization options for users who want to maximize their streaming experience. With the current implementation, users may occasionally experience slower streaming speeds.

If you encounter issues, please understand that it may take time to find solutions or alternative providers. I'll work on fixes when I can, but as this is a side project with limited resources, patience is appreciated.
