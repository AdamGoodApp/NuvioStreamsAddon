# Hey r/StremioAddons!

I'm back with an update to the **Nuvio Streaming Addon** for Stremio.

After receiving feedback and working on improvements, I'm excited to announce **version 0.2.0**. This update includes several important features that should enhance reliability and performance for users willing to do a bit of extra configuration.

# What's New in v0.2.0:

* **Personal Cookie Configuration** \- You can now use your own cookie for one of the main providers, giving you dedicated bandwidth and no size restrictions
* **Two New Providers Added** \- Now supporting a total of four providers to improve content availability
* **Stream Size Management** \- Non-personalized users will see a file size cap on certain providers to avoid bandwidth exhaustion
* **Stream Quality Improvements** \- Better sorting and presentation of streams by quality and source
* **Performance Optimizations** \- Various backend improvements for faster fetching and better reliability

# About this addon:

* **Multiple Providers** \- Now includes four providers (up from the previous two)
* **Content Availability** \- Attempts to find streams for movies and TV shows when available
* **High Quality Support** \- Some providers support 4K, HDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision content when available
* **Experimental Nature** \- This is a work in progress with no guarantee on how long it will last
* **Indie Development** \- As a solo developer, I'll try to fix or replace broken providers when I can
* **No Guarantees** \- Providers can change or disappear at any time without warning

>**Important Note:** While I've added more providers to improve reliability, this is still a scraper addon that depends on external services. As an independent developer, I'll do my best to maintain it, but functionality can still break unexpectedly.

**Disclaimer:** This addon is a personal project intended for educational purposes.

# Where to find it:

# Nuvio Streaming Addon for Stremio

**Installation Links:**
* [**Nuvio Streams Addon**](https://nuvioaddon.vercel.app)
* [**Stremio Community Addons Page**](https://beta.stremio-addons.net/addons/nuvio-streams)

>**Note:** The addon is now available both through its dedicated website and on the official Stremio Community Addons page. You can install or configure it from either location.

# Personalized Configuration  (New Feature)

A key new feature in v0.2.0 is the ability to use your own cookie for one of the main providers:

* **Why personalize?** Without personalization, you'll share limited bandwidth with other addon users and be restricted to smaller file sizes (under 9GB)
* **Benefits of personalization:** Your own dedicated 100GB monthly quota, faster speeds, and no file size restrictions
* **How to set it up:** Visit the addon's configuration page and follow the step-by-step instructions to get and set your own cookie

This feature is **Extremely Recommended** for the best experience, especially if you want access to larger, higher-quality streams including 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision content.

>**Future Notice:** Due to extremely limited resources, I plan to eventually transition this addon to only support personalized cookies. If the addon and providers are still operational in the coming months, non-personalized access will likely be phased out. I strongly encourage setting up your personal cookie now to ensure continued access.
>
>**Coming Soon:** Additional configuration options such as selecting which providers to use and customizing quality sorting will be implemented in future updates based on user feedback and requests.

# Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: What's the difference between personalized and non-personalized usage?**  
A: Non-personalized users share limited bandwidth and can only access streams under 9GB from certain providers. Personalized users get their own 100GB monthly quota and access to all quality levels.

**Q: Does this addon use torrents or P2P technology?**  
A: No. This addon only scrapes direct HTTP streams from websites. It does not use P2P or torrents.

**Q: Why do some streams not work?**  
A: Providers can change their websites or go offline at any time. When this happens, streams will stop working until I update the addon.

**Q: Can I contact you if I have issues with my personalized setup?**  
A: Yes! Comment below, or DM me.

**Q: How often is the addon updated?**  
A: As an indie developer with limited time, I update when I can. If a provider breaks, I'll try to fix it or find a replacement.

**Q: Will more providers be added?**  
A: I'm always looking for reliable providers to add. With this update, I've already added two new ones.

If you encounter issues, you can DM me or comment below. Please understand that it may take time to find solutions or alternative providers.
