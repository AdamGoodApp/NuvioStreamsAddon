```

## üìù Step-by-Step Installation

### What You'll Need

- **Computer** with internet access (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- **Node.js** (version 16 or newer) - This runs the addon
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) - This helps install the needed files
- **Basic computer skills** - Using terminal/command prompt, editing text files

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Node.js

1. Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version
3. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
4. To verify it's installed, open terminal/command prompt and type:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   You should see version numbers for both

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Addon Code

1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to where you want to store the addon
3. Run these commands:

```bash
# This downloads the code
git clone https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon.git

# This moves into the downloaded folder
cd NuvioStreamsAddon
```

If you don't have `git` installed, you can:
- [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Extract it to a folder
- Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to that folder

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Dependencies are extra pieces of code the addon needs to work.

```bash
# This installs everything needed
npm install
```

This might take a minute or two. You'll see a progress bar and some text output.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file using any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
   - Find the line with `TMDB_API_KEY=` and add your API key after the equals sign
   
   To get a TMDB API key:
   1. Create a free account at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
   2. Go to [Settings ‚Üí API](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) after logging in
   3. Request an API key for personal use
   4. Copy the API key they give you

3. Save and close the file

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Addon

```bash
npm start
```

You should see output that ends with something like:
```
Addon running at: http://localhost:7000/manifest.json
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Install in Stremio

1. Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:7000`
2. You'll see a page with an "Install Addon" button
3. Click the button - this will open Stremio with an installation prompt
4. Click "Install" in Stremio
5. That's it! The addon is now installed in your Stremio

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

Let's look at the important settings you can change in the `.env` file. Don't worry - we'll explain what each one does!

### Basic Settings (Most Important)

```env
# The only REQUIRED setting - get from themoviedb.org
TMDB_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Provider Settings

These control which streaming sources are active:

```env
# Turn providers on (true) or off (false)
ENABLE_VIDZEE_PROVIDER=true
ENABLE_HOLLYMOVIEHD_PROVIDER=true
ENABLE_XPRIME_PROVIDER=true
ENABLE_CUEVANA_PROVIDER=false
```

| Provider | What It Offers | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| VidZee | Movies | Easy to set up |
| HollyMovieHD | Movies & TV shows | Good quality |
| Xprime.tv | Movies & TV shows | Works best with personal setup |
| Cuevana | Spanish/LATAM content | Only works when self-hosting |

### Improving Performance (Optional)

These settings help your addon run faster and use less resources:

```env
# Cache settings - "false" means caching is ON (which is good)
DISABLE_CACHE=false
DISABLE_STREAM_CACHE=false
```

Caching saves previous searches and results, making everything faster!

### ShowBox Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

ShowBox is one of the best providers but needs a bit more setup:

#### Personal Cookie (Best Experience)

1. Create a file named `cookies.txt` in the main folder
2. Add your ShowBox cookie to this file

To get a ShowBox cookie:
1. Visit [showbox.media](https://showbox.media/) in your browser
2. Log in or create an account
3. Press F12 to open developer tools
4. Go to "Application" tab ‚Üí "Cookies" ‚Üí find the site
5. Copy the cookie value
6. Paste into your `cookies.txt` file

With your own cookie:
- You get your own 100GB monthly quota
- Access to higher quality streams (4K/HDR)
- Faster speeds

## üöë Troubleshooting

### Common Problem: No Streams Found

**What to try:**
1. **Be patient** - sometimes it takes 30+ seconds to find streams
2. **Try again** - click the same movie/show again after a minute
3. **Check provider settings** - make sure providers are enabled

### Common Problem: Addon Won't Start

**What to try:**
1. Make sure Node.js is installed correctly
2. Check you've run `npm install`
3. Verify the `.env` file exists
4. Look for error messages in the terminal

### Common Problem: Slow Performance

**What to try:**
1. Enable caching: Set `DISABLE_CACHE=false` and `DISABLE_STREAM_CACHE=false`
2. Use your own ShowBox cookie
3. Only enable the providers you actually use

## üöÄ Running Your Addon All the Time

If you want your addon to keep running even when you close the terminal:

### Windows Method:

1. Create a file called `start.bat` with these contents:
   ```
   @echo off
   cd /d %~dp0
   npm start
   pause
   ```
2. Double-click this file to start your addon

### Using PM2 (Advanced):

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start the addon with PM2
pm2 start npm --name "nuvio-streams" -- start

# Make it start when your computer restarts
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

## üì± Accessing From Other Devices

Once your addon is running, you can use it on any device on your home network:

1. Find your computer's IP address:
   - Windows: Type `ipconfig` in command prompt
   - Mac/Linux: Type `ifconfig` or `ip addr` in terminal
   
2. Use this address in Stremio on other devices:
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:7000/manifest.json`

## üí™ Optimization Tips

For the best experience:

1. **Enable caching** - Makes everything faster
   ```env
   DISABLE_CACHE=false
   DISABLE_STREAM_CACHE=false
   ```

2. **Use personal cookies** - Get your own bandwidth quota
   - Create and set up `cookies.txt` file

3. **Only enable providers you use** - Reduces search time
   - Turn off unused providers in your `.env` file

4. **Keep your addon updated**
   - Check for updates weekly:
   ```bash
   cd NuvioStreamsAddon
   git pull
   npm install
   ```

## üéâ Success!

Congratulations! You now have your own personal streaming addon with:

- ‚úÖ Multiple streaming sources
- ‚úÖ Your own bandwidth quotas
- ‚úÖ No limits on stream quality
- ‚úÖ Full control over settings

Happy streaming! üçø
