# Nuvio Streams: Thank You for the Amazing Support - Now Open Source

# Hey r/StremioAddons,

As mentioned in my previous post, I'm announcing that Nuvio Streams Addon is now open source.

# What This Means For You:

* **Full Source Code Access**: Examine how everything works under the hood
* **Self-Host Your Own Instance**: Control your streaming experience
* **Customize Providers**: Modify existing providers or add your own
* **Better Reliability**: No dependence on a single hosted instance

# Repository Link:

[GitHub: Nuvio Streams Addon](https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon)

# Official Instance Links:

* [Nuvio Streams Addon (Main Page)](https://nuvioaddon.vercel.app) \- Install or configure here
* [Stremio Community Addons Page](https://beta.stremio-addons.net/addons/nuvio-streams) \- Also available on the official community list

# Why I'm Open-Sourcing:

The longevity of this addon depends on community involvement. By making it open source, Nuvio Streams can continue to evolve even if I'm not able to maintain it full-time.

# Self-Hosting Benefits:

* **Privacy**: Your streaming activity stays on your own server
* **Stability**: Not affected by the public instance's load
* **Customization**: Configure according to your preferences

# Getting Started:

The repository includes a self-hosting guide in the [README.md](https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon/blob/main/README.md) file. Basic steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure your instance
4. Run the addon

# Contributing:

Contributions are welcomed. Code improvements, bug fixes, documentation, or new providers - all help keep this addon functional.

Thank you for your support and feedback that made this addon possible. Open-sourcing is the best way to ensure its continued development and usefulness to the community.

If you find Nuvio Streams valuable, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/tapframe) to support ongoing development.
